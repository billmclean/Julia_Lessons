# Julia_Lessons

A set of short lessons introducing Julia for mathematical computing.

The shell script `bin/md2html` uses Pandoc to convert a markdown file to html.
For example, assuming that `md2html` is in your path,
```
md2html lesson04
```
converts `lesson04.md` to `lesson04.html`.  The script `markdown/update_all.sh`
updates all ten lessons, copying the html files to the `html` folder where
they can be accessed from `index.html`.
